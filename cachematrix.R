#   Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
#   
#   Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a 
#   matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
#   Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.
#   
#   Write the following functions:
#   
#   makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
#   cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
#   If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
#   Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
#   
#   For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
